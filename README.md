Highlighting Your Projects
Your projects should be featured prominently on your portfolio. You'll want future employers to see what you accomplished both while you were at GA and after completing this program.

- List projects in reverse chronological order. Your capstone is likely the project that best showcases your skills. Make sure it's featured prominently as the first project in your portfolio.
- For your team project, be sure to fork, clone, and individually redeploy your project to maintain individual ownership over the site showcased on your portfolio.
- Include links to your live site as well as front-end and back-end repos.
- Summarize the functionality of the app as well as what technologies you used to build it.
- Briefly describe your process for building each app. If you have a blog post that goes into detail for each project, link to that post.
- Make sure your projects are user-friendly to an unacquainted visitor.
    - The home page should explain the siteâ€™s functionality
    - Random users might not want to sign up/sign in. Consider adding dummy credentials on the homepage that they can use (and explain that), or make sure they can interact with the site without signing up.
- After you've completed the program, revisit your projects and refactor them. Add new features. Improve the user experience. Fix any open issues. Enhance the app's design aesthetic.
- Clean up test data and create some seed data that you can use to easily refresh your database. If you want to get fancy, you can write a scheduled task that drops, recreates, and reseeds your database periodically.
